Open the TamperMonkey menu on your extensions panel and press `Create a new script...`.

Delete all the code that is already in the editor and paste in the following code:
```js
// ==UserScript==
// @name         Lyrics Status
// @namespace    -
// @version      -
// @description  Synchronizes your Discord status with the lyrics of any song you are listening to on Spotify!
// @author       OvalQuilter
// @match        *://open.spotify.com/*
// @icon         https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OvalQuilter/lyrics-status/main/Logo.png
// @grant        none
// @require      https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js
// ==/UserScript==

$.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OvalQuilter/lyrics-status/main/LyricsStatus.js", (d) => eval(d));
```
Then click on the `File` dropdown in the top left, and press `Save`.

Now open the [Spotify website](https://open.spotify.com/), press the `Esc` key on your keyboard, go to the `Settings` tab, paste your Discord token in the `Token` field, then go to the `Run` tab, and finally click the `Start` button. Enjoy!

# Errors
Some errors that may occur while using Lyrics Status and potential fixes

`404` - Means there are no lyrics for the current song. Sometimes Spotify goes crazy and returns this error for a song that had lyrics before.

`502` - Wait a couple minutes or reload the webpage. It may be a problem with Spotify as opposed to the script.
